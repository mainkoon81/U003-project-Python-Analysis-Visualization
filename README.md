__Data:__ original source on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments) This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row. Be careful about the encoding of the last column: it says ‘No’ if the patient showed up to their appointment, and ‘Yes’ if they did not show up.
 - ‘ScheduledDay’ tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment.
 - ‘Neighborhood’ indicates the location of the hospital.
 - ‘Scholarship’ indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program Bolsa Família.

### Q1. What factors are important for us to know in order to predict if a patient will show up for their scheduled appointment?¶
### Q2. Which factor combination create a significant difference in 'show-up rate' ? Which factor should be fixed for these combination test?
